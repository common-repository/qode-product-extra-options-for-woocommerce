<h3>Display Comprehensive Free or Paid Extra Options for Any of Your Products</h3>

The <strong>QODE Product Extra Options for WooCommerce</strong> plugin provides you with a <strong>simple and completely flexible</strong> way to add <strong>multiple selectable</strong> options for your products.

These advanced options located next to your products can be either <strong>paid, free</strong> or <strong>sale</strong> options, which correspondingly affects the total price of the product.

On top of that you get to choose <strong>where and how</strong> you wish to display the extra options.

Depending on the type of the option, they can feature labels, images, some descriptive text, prices, and they can also be set as <strong>required</strong> in order for the purchase to be completed.

The <strong>price totals</strong> can be adjusted in such a way that the added options affect the price in real time, with <strong>subtotals</strong> and <strong>final prices</strong> calculated and displayed on the fly on that very page.

<h3>Easily Configure Options With the Help of an Extensive Library of Option Elements</h3>

Thanks to the plugin's <strong>comprehensive set of option elements</strong>, the extra options can be featured in checkboxes, radio buttons, text input fields, text areas, color swatches, number fields, dropdown selectors, labels or images, date selectors, color pickers and more.

Each of these option types can be adjusted and <strong>modified individually</strong>. This includes adding custom labels, prices, images, and lots more.

Shoppers can select either <strong>one or multiple options</strong>, depending on how you configured them.

You also have the ability to allow users to <strong>select a specific number of options for free</strong>, with every subsequent option added to the purchase impacting the price.

The <strong>appearance</strong> of each option can be <strong>fully customized</strong> in a clear-cut and intuitive manner.
